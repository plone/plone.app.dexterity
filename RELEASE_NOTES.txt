Changes
-------

plone.app.dexterity 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Give a more explicit warning before deleting content types that have existing
  instances.
  [davisagli]

- Add validation to prevent giving a type the same name as an existing type.
  [davisagli]

- Make sure the title and description of new FTIs are stored encoded,
  and with a default i18n domain of 'plone'.
  [davisagli]

  Jquery Tools date picker for date/time fields.
  [davisagli]

  [davisagli]

- Bugfix: Fix display of type descriptions in the types control panel.
  [davisagli]

  [jonstahl, davisagli]

plone.dexterity 1.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix UnicodeDecodeError when getting an FTI title or description with
  non-ASCII characters.
  [davisagli]

* When deleting items from a container using manage_delObjects,
  check for the "DeleteObjects" permission on each item being
  deleted. This fixes

  [davisagli]

plone.schemaeditor 1.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Display fields from behaviors in the schema preview too.
  [davisagli]

* Prevent the user from creating fields with names that are reserved for
  Dublin Core metadata. ``title`` and ``description`` can still be used
  as long as the fields are of the correct type.
  [davisagli]

* Remove unhelpful help text for min_length and max_length fields.
  [davisagli]

* The schema listing preview now respects autoform hints (such as custom
  widgets).
  [davisagli]

* Make new boolean fields use the radio widget by default. The field now
  appears as "Yes/No" in the list of field types.
  [davisagli]

* Hide the 'read only' setting for fields.
  [davisagli]

* Edit field defaults from the schema listing instead of in the field
  overlays. This simplifies making sure that the default can't be set
  to invalid values.
  [davisagli]

* Limit the height of text areas in the schema listing to avoid extra
  scrolling.
  [davisagli]

* Fall back to normal traversal if a field isn't found when traversing the
  schema context. This fixes inline validation for forms on the schema
  context.
  [davisagli]

* Make it possible to make the schemaeditor not be the default view of the
  schema context, by specifying the ``schemaEditorView`` attribute on the
  schema context.
  [davisagli]

* Added Spanish translation.
