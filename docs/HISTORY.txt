  [davisagli]

1.0rc1 - 2011-04-30
-------------------

- Added upgrade step to install new javascript from
  plone.formwidget.autocomplete
  [davisagli]

- Added basic support for making TTW changes to schemas defined in filesystem
  models and code. (Note: This feature will not actually work until some further
  changes are completed in plone.dexterity.)

  In order to support this change, the event handling to serialize schema changes
  was revised. We now register a single event handler for the SchemaModifiedEvent
  raised for the schema context. This allows us to keep track of the FTI
  that changes need to be serialized to on the schema context. The
  serializeSchemaOnFieldEvent and serializeSchemaOnSchemaEvent handlers were
  removed from the serialize module and replaced by serializeSchemaContext. The
  serializeSchema helper remains but is deprecated.
  [davisagli]

- Add MANIFEST.in.
  [WouterVH]

- Add "export" button to types editor. Exports GS-style zip archive of type
  info for selected types.

  [davisagli]

- Enable the "Name from title" behavior for new types, by default.
  [davisagli]

  available out of the box.  You must explicitly include z3c.blobfile in your
  environment if you want blob-based files.
  [davisagli]

- Added a DexterityLayer that can be used in tests.
  [davisagli]

- Fix issue with the BehaviorsForm accidentally polluting the title of the

  do in AT content.
  [davisagli]

- Make sure the current user is loaded as the default creator for the
  IOwnership schema in an add form.

  panel did not raise NotFound.

  [davisagli]


1.0a6 - 2009-10-12
------------------

- Add plone.app.textfield as a dependency. We don't use it directly in this
  package, but users of Dexterity should have it installed and available.
  [optilude]

- Use some default icons for new types.
  [davisagli]

- Show type icons in type listing if available.
  [davisagli]

- Removed 'container' field from the types listing in the control panel
  (it wasn't working).

  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=75.
  [optilude]

- Patch listActionInfos() instead of listActions() in order to get the
  folder/add category into the actions list. This avoids a problem with
  the 'actions.xml' export handler exporting the folder/add category
  incorrectly. Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78
  [optilude]


1.0a5 - 2009-07-26
------------------

- Explicitly include overrides.zcml from plone.app.z3cform.
  [optilude]


1.0a4 - 2009-07-12
------------------

  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. serialize_schema()
  becomes serializeSchema().
  [optilude]


1.0a3 - 2009-06-07
------------------

- Updated use of <plone:behavior /> directive to match plone.behavior 1.0b4.
  [optilude]


1.0a2 - 2009-06-01
------------------

  a problem when the package is loaded via z3c.autoinclude.plugin

--------------------

- Initial release
