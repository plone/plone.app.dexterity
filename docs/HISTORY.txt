  upgraded from Dexterity 1.0 to Dexterity 2.0, or the site will break.

  [davisagli]

- Make sure the Basic metadata adapter accesses the content's title attribute
  directly so it doesn't get encoded. Also make sure encoded data can't be set
  via this adapter.
  [davisagli]

1.0rc1 - 2011-04-30
-------------------

- Added upgrade step to install new javascript from
  plone.formwidget.autocomplete
  [davisagli]

- Added basic support for making TTW changes to schemas defined in filesystem
  models and code. (Note: This feature will not actually work until some further
  changes are completed in plone.dexterity.)

  In order to support this change, the event handling to serialize schema changes
  was revised. We now register a single event handler for the SchemaModifiedEvent
  raised for the schema context. This allows us to keep track of the FTI
  that changes need to be serialized to on the schema context. The
  serializeSchemaOnFieldEvent and serializeSchemaOnSchemaEvent handlers were
  removed from the serialize module and replaced by serializeSchemaContext. The
  serializeSchema helper remains but is deprecated.
  [davisagli]

- Add MANIFEST.in.
  [WouterVH]

- Add "export" button to types editor. Exports GS-style zip archive of type
  info for selected types.

  [davisagli]

  available out of the box.  You must explicitly include z3c.blobfile in your
  environment if you want blob-based files.
  [davisagli]

- Added a DexterityLayer that can be used in tests.
  [davisagli]

- Fix issue with the BehaviorsForm accidentally polluting the title of the
  z3c.form EditForm 'Apply' button.
  [davisagli]

- Add upgrades folder and make sure plone.app.z3cform profile gets installed
  on upgrades from previous versions of Dexterity.
  [davisagli]

- Depend on the plone.app.z3cform profile, to make sure the Plone browser layer
  for z3c.form gets installed.
  [davisagli]

  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=75.
  [optilude]

- Patch listActionInfos() instead of listActions() in order to get the
  folder/add category into the actions list. This avoids a problem with
  the 'actions.xml' export handler exporting the folder/add category
  incorrectly. Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78

  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. serialize_schema()
  becomes serializeSchema().
