**About this manual**

This manual should teach you everything you need to know to write your own behaviors, but not how to integrate them into another framework.

*Behaviors* are reusable bundles of functionality that can be enabled or disabled on a per-content type basis.
Examples might include:

-  A set of form fields (on standard add and edit forms),
-  Enabling particular event handler,
-  Enabling one or more views, viewlets or other UI components,
-  Anything else which may be expressed in code via an adapter and/or marker interface.

You would typically not write a behavior as a one-off.
Behaviors are normally used when:

-  You want to share fields and functionality across multiple types easily.
   Behaviors allow you to write a schema and associated components (e.g. adapters, event handlers, views, viwelets) once and reuse them easily.
-  A more experienced developer is making functionality available for reuse by less experienced integrators.
   For example, a behavior can be packaged up and release as an add-on product.
   Integrators can then install that product and use the behavior in their own types, either in code or through-the-web.

This manual is aimed at developers who want to write new behaviors.
This is a slightly more advanced topic than the writing of custom content types.
It assumes you are familiar with buildout, know how to create a custom package, understand interfaces and have a basic understanding of Zope’s component architecture.

Behaviors are not tied to Dexterity, but Dexterity provides behavior support for its types via the *behaviors* FTI property.
In fact, if you’ve used Dexterity before, you’ve probably used some behaviors.
Take a look at the `Dexterity Developer Manual`_ for more information about how to enable behaviors on a type and for a list of standard behaviors.

To learn more about how behaviors in detail are implemented, see the `plone.behavior`_ package.
